- This application needs to consist of the following. 
-  Ability to take in two inputs and a flag
- A directory that contains the files that are to be analyzed
- A path for the output file (including file name and extension)
- A flag to determine whether or not to include subdirectories contained (and all subsequently embedded subdirectories) within the input directory ([a.] above)

- Determines using a file signature if a given file is a PDF or a JPG.

- PDF files start with 0x25504446
- For each file that is a PDF or a JPG, creates an entry in the output CSV containing the following information
